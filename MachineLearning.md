## General Questions
1. Differentiate ML algorithm with other algorithms.
ML algorithm is data-driven. It does not have predetermined definition but it leaves the answer to the data and let the data to telll the story.</br>
* <b>Supervised Learning: </b> Using labeled data, which facilitate the ability to reach an accurrate decision when given new data. 
* <b>UnSupervised Learning </b> Using data that is not labeled and will try to find patterns and relationships therein. 
* <b>Active Learning (Semi-supervised) </b> The algorithm itseld decides which thing need to be labeled. 

2. Differenciate Data Mining and Machine Learning
* Data Mining: the process of extractng useful info from vast amount of data. It is also refered as Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD). The purpose of KDD is extract and explore the data. It is control by people.
* Machine Learing: the process of dicovering algorithm that improve the decision making driven by data. The purpose is to continuously decrease the influence of human and use the power of algorithm to permite machine to learn without or with limited human intervention.
